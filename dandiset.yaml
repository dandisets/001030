description: 2 kHz stimulation of hippocampal neurons under different amplitudes (measured
  as one polarity, V; peak-to-peak would be two-fold larger). Sine wave amplitude
  is gradually increased during the initial 0.25 s, then stays constant at the voltage
  indicated in session descriptions. Sine wave stimulation begins at 25 ms and lasts
  2 s. For the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into 36 V/cm. The study
  was supported in part by NIH 15R21EY034803.
