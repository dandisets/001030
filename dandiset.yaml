description: 2 kHz stimulation of hippocampal neurons under 1.5V amplitude (measured
  as one polarity, V; peak-to-peak would be two-fold larger). Sine wave amplitude
  is gradually increased during the initial 0.25 s, then stays constant at the voltage
  indicated in the before. Sine wave stimulation begins at 25 ms and lasts 2 s. For
  the employed electrode configuration, 1V translates into to 36 V/cm. The study was
  supported in part by NIH 15R21EY034803
